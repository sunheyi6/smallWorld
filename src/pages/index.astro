      <strong>smallworld</strong> is a lightweight <a
        href="https://astro.build/"
        target="_blank">Astro</a
      > theme for people who only want a simple blog and personal site. I built it
      after spending hours messing with other templates and their CSS, &lt;div&gt;
      elements, and NPM packages. The result is a minimal, responsive site that I
      think looks pretty good.
    </p>
    <p>This theme uses Pico CSS in its SASS form to limit CSS output to the essentials.</p>

    <h2>Design principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scale font sizes responsively.</li>
      <li>Write as little CSS as possible.</li>
      <li>Use as few classes as possible.</li>
      <li>Maximize the use of semantic HTML.</li>
      <li>Limit the number of installed NPM packages.</li>
      <li>Avoid anything that would go beyond static HTML.</li>
      <li>Don't go beyond basic Markdown.</li>
      <li>Don't just reinvent BearBlog.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If that sounds good to you, this theme might be for you!</p>
